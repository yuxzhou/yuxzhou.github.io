I am currently a [**Schmidt AI Fellow**](https://saiis.site.ox.ac.uk/our-people) at the University of Oxford. I obtained my DPhil from the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oxford under the supervision of [**Prof. Volker Deringer**](https://deringer.chem.ox.ac.uk). Prior to my DPhil, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at Xi'an Jiaotong University under the supervision of [**Prof. Wei Zhang**](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/wzhang0). Following my doctoral studies, I continued as a postdoctoral researcher for half a year before commencing my current fellowship.

My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and chemistry. I spent four years completing my DPhil and have continued to contribute to the academic community at Oxford through my subsequent roles.
